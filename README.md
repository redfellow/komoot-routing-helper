- This is a visual helper only.
- It does not modify your route or create a route for you.
- It is designed to make map reading easier, especially for MTB planning.

The extension stores your local preferences in the browser and reads the page state needed to apply the visual styling. It does not upload routes or personal ride data to a remote service.
